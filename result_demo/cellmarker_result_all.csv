29183737,"For example, a fraction of cells that otherwise show very strong stromal type gene expression patterns nevertheless also show expression of Six2, a nephron progenitor marker, and similarly a significant fraction of cells that cluster well with nephron progenitors nevertheless express Foxd1, a classic marker of the stromal lineage (Fig. 7).",stromal lineage,Foxd1,"In this report we show that the nephrogenic zone stroma, as well as cap mesenchyme, both express Gdnf, blurring the functional boundary between these two compartments..

Consistent with the Drop-Seq, Fluidigm and Chromium scRNA-Seq data, the Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization data, and the GUDMAP FACS or RNA-Seq data, we observed stromal cell expression of Gdnf in cells that were not SIX2 positive, and were therefore likely stromal cells ( Fig. 9D,E,E' ) .",mouse,kidney|mesenchyme,normal,Cross-platform single cell analysis of kidney development shows stromal cells express Gdnf.,2018,Developmental biology
37275903,"Treatment of mesenchymal fibroblasts with neutralizing antibodies to POSTN, a marker gene for mesenchymal fibroblasts, significantly inhibited collagen synthesis (46).",mesenchymal fibroblast,POSTN,"Moreover, the trend of differentiation toward mesenchymal fibroblasts was suppressed in treated keloids in pseudotime analysis..
