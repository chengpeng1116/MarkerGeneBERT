29183737,"We further confirmed this by Gdnf in situ hybridization coupled with IHC for MEIS1, a specific marker of the stromal lineage.",stromal lineage,MEIS1,"To still further validate the expression of Gdnf by stromal cells we carried out double Gdnf in situ hybridization coupled with SIX2 or MEIS1 IHC.. Consistent with the Drop-Seq, Fluidigm and Chromium scRNA-Seq data, the Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization data, and the GUDMAP FACS or RNA-Seq data, we observed stromal cell expression of Gdnf in cells that were not SIX2 positive, and were therefore likely stromal cells ( Fig. 9D,E,E' ) .",mouse,kidney|mesenchyme,normal,Cross-platform single cell analysis of kidney development shows stromal cells express Gdnf.,2018,Developmental biology
