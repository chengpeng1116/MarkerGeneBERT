26940531,"Cells 1 and 2 are considered candidate CB glomus cells as a result of their expression of glomus cell markers Th (tyrosine hydroxylase), Uchl1 (ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1) and Kcnk3 (potassium channel subfamily K member 3).",candidate Carotid body glomus cell,Th,"Figure 3 .3Figure 3.. Transcriptome comparison of single CB glomus cells A, representative marker genes analysis for four single cells isolated from CB dissociations.",mouse,non carotid|tube,GLOMUS,Single cell transcriptome analysis of mouse carotid body glomus cells.,2017,The Journal of physiology
26940531,"Each single cell-derived cDNA sample was used as a template for PCR diagnosis with primers complementary to three glomus cell markers (Th, tyrosine hydroxylase; Uchl1, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1, also known as PGP9.5; Kcnk3, potassium channel subfamily K member 3, also known as TASK1), as well as a housekeeping gene Gapdh.",glomus cell,Kcnk3,"We dissociated tissues containing the CB, picked single cells and amplified cDNAs derived from each single cell.. To select cDNA samples derived from CB glomus cells, we conducted marker genes analysis.",mouse,non carotid|tube,GLOMUS,Single cell transcriptome analysis of mouse carotid body glomus cells.,2017,The Journal of physiology
